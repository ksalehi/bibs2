# Website for the Brown Institute for Brain Science.

Notes from CIM:

Splash page - big images attached to 3 themes:

(1) Driving Discovery and Innovation

3D brain fly through, maybe a dynamic moving network like libd.org

(2) A Community of Diverse Opinions, Open Minds and Disruptive Ideas

Photo from Brain Week RI, neuro practicum, Hackerspace, etc.

(3) From Great Ideas to Real Solutions

On each of these screens, there should be a 'learn more' button, and that should kick to a page with links to groupings of people at Brown by areas of expertise so that it's easy for a student/donor/outsider to appreciate how great BIBS is.  Scrolling down should also lead to this page. This page of key example areas should look something like the following:

An image with a title and a link for each of these categories (boxes with images).

Text at the top - "Brown is a fantastic environment for discovery and innovation.  The unique combination of world-class researchers in a friendly, interactive environment provides ideal soil for growing great new ideas into real progress and a better world.  This environment also is ideal for educating the next generation of scholars focused on making an impact."

Examples of key areas of world-class work at BIBS:

* New Tools that Advance Brain Science - feature Gilad, BL-OG, Hochberg

* Cutting Edge Computation at All Levels - feature Michael etc.

* Moving Great Ideas xxx - feature Asaad!

* A Great Environment for the Next Generation of Discovery - and Innovation-Focused Scholars/Scientists Brown is an inclusive community that places great value on training the next generation of great scientists.  We deeply value the contributions students make as equal partners in discovery and innovation. Feature PIBS, NSGP with emphasis on neuro practicum, neuroengineering.

* Basic Science that Builds the Future of Insight
This is meant to feature things that aren't as demonstrably sexy, but emphasize how strong we are across many levels -- so perhaps 4 faculty profiles (Molecular person: David B. and Barry: Sheinberg and Theresa: Amso and Badre) and the 6 students that will be part of the day.

* Classic papers from Brown linked to a timeline / Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

* The Community that Makes BIBS Great Advisory Council with photos - contacting them for this would be great way of flagging them to the website, BIBS faculty hires with profiles
Above the above-the-fold carousel is a nav bar of clean text with clickable options in small caps:

* For the Brown Community (= the internal Brown Sites regulated page, Innovator award information, etc.)
* Events
* Education
* Donate
* News and Press
* Tools and Resources
* BIBS BL-OG
